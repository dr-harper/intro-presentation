A repository for presentations. More to be added soon!

## My Presentations

- [A life in graphics](1810-intro/introPresentation.html): an introduction presentation used when starting at work at Flowminder.
- [Introducing Git](1810-using-git/using-git.html)

# Making the Presentations

The presentations are written using **rmarkdown** [@R-rmarkdown] and the presentation package **xaringan** [@R-xaringan]. More can be found out about this presentation format within the [R Markdown Definitve Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html).

If you are interested in seeing how the presentations were written, feel free to review the source code of this repository: https://github.com/dr-harper/presentations
