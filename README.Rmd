## My Presentations

- [A life in graphics](20181005-intro-presentation/introPresentation.html): an introduction presentation used when starting at work at Flowminder.


# Making the Presentations

The presentations are written using **rmarkdown** [@R-rmarkdown] and the presentation package **xaringan** [@R-xaringan]. More can be found out about this presentation format within the [R Markdown Definitve Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html).
