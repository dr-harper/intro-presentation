# Making the Presentations

The presentations are written using **rmarkdown** [@R-rmarkdown] and the presentation package **xaringan** [@R-xaringan]. More can be found out about this presentation format within the [R Markdown Definitve Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html).

If you are interested in seeing how the presentations were written, feel free to review the source code of this repository: https://github.com/dr-harper/presentations
